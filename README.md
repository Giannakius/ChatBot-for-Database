# Chatbot Implementation for AI Programming Competition

## Description
This is a chatbot implementation completed within one day for an AI programming competition, Makeathon, held in Athens. During the competition, our team was challenged by a company to create a bot that interfaces with a SQL database.

## Features
- Developed a Unix web application in a chat format.
- Users can ask the bot any questions related to the provided database.
- The bot translates natural language queries into SQL queries.
- Retrieves answers from the database and returns them in a structured format in natural language.

## How it Works
Users interact with the Unix web application through chat. They can ask the bot any questions they have regarding the database. The bot translates these questions from natural language to SQL, retrieves the answers from the database, and returns them in a structured format back to the user.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Database: SQL
